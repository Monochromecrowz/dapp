          Crowz is a decentralized collab platform that lets members pool to snag digital goods together. No more
          strugglin' solo to afford digital resources - now you can crowdfund it with your buds!
          <br />
          <br />
          Anyone can pitch a digital asset they're itching to own, then rally their crew to chip in and make it happen.
          Once enough crowz have thrown down, the asset gets purchased and encrypted by the proposer. Then, it's
          uploaded onto the platform for all the crowz who put in their dough to access.
