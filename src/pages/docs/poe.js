          Crowz uses a novel consensus algorithm called proof-of-encryption. Anybody who has participated in a proposal
          can encrypt the access message for newcomers. As a reward, they earn 5% of the collected funds for encrypting
          the message.

          The outcome of this innovative approach is a truly decentralized ecosystem, which functions autonomously and
          does not rely on centralized servers or a single originator to sustain its operation.
